# IP creator (makeip) additional resources

**IP creator** (`makeip`) is an utility used for generating homebrew Sega Dreamcast bootstrap files, also known as IP for Initial Program. This file is often known as `IP.BIN` files.

This directory contains several useful resources:

* IP bootstrap template
* IP fields template

## IP bootstrap template

Bootstrap templates are the files containing the bootstrap code itself. You may pass this file to the **IP creator** program by using the `-t` switch.

* `ip.tmpl`: The IP template file provided in the **IP.BIN Replacement** package. This is the default IP template embedded in the **IP creator** utility.
* `ipalt.tmpl`: The original `IP.TMPL` provided with the original `makeip` package. It uses the `AIP` library from Sega, which has been completely removed in the **IP.BIN Replacement** package.

## IP fields template

These files may be used to pass arguments to the **IP creator** program instead of using the command line arguments. To use it, you just have to enter `makeip ip.txt IP.BIN`.

* `ip.txt`: The new, modernized IP template file.
* `ipalt.txt`: The original `ip.txt` file provided with the original `makeip` package, which is still supported in this version of **IP creator**.
