# makeip

Tool to create IP.BIN files that are used to make self bootable CD-Rs for the Sega Dreamcast.

This is basically an enhancement on Marcus Comstedt's work. We can now use command arguments to
generate an IP.BIN and we no longer depend on the IP.TMPL file. Its also backwards compatible so
you can still use the ip.txt if you choose. Another enhancement is MR Image insertion into the 
IP.BIN. This image is shown during the boot screen. For example:

![alt text](img/mdlogo.png "Example")


Included in this repo is a plugin(**file-mr.py**) you can use to create .mr images in GIMP. **Make sure to read the MR Image Restrictions restrictions!**

## GIMP Plugin

GIMP is a cross-platform image editor available for GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows [https://www.gimp.org/]

Using this plugin, you can load and save .mr files that you've created in GIMP. Verified to work in GIMP 2.10
and GIMP 2.8

**Installing:**

1. You'll need to make it executable: ```chmod 755 file-mr.py``` or the equivalent from your file manager
2. Place the plugin in the plugins directory. This directory is different depending on what system your on.  
   To find out go to GIMP => Preferences => Folders (*Expand option*) => Plugins.  There it will show a list 
   of directories you can place the plugin
3. That's it!

## MR Image Restrictions

**Image must be:**

1. **320x90** or less
2. Less than **128** colors
3. Less than **8192** bytes to fit in a IP.BIN
4. The transparent color is **#c0c0c0**, or 192, 192, 192 in RGB
